# FullStack Todo App - MERN Stack

This repository provides a starter kit code for building a FullStack Todo App using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The code is organized into two main folders: `backend` and `client`.

`Please note that This repository serves as a starting point, but feel free to create everything from scratch following your own project requirements`

## Getting Started

### Instructions

1. Navigate to the backend folder and install the required Node.js packages:

```shell
cd backend
npm install

```

2. Set up your MongoDB database. You can either install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.

3. In the .env file in the backend folder add your MongoDB connection URL. For example:

```shell
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-url

```

4. Start coding & build your project backend

#### client

The React frontend is provided with some useful comments. You should enhance the UI, implement the todo list functionality, and interact with the backend API. Key components are located in the client/src/components folder.

- Open a new terminal window, navigate to the client folder, and install the required React packages:

```shell
cd client
npm install

```

- Start the React development server:

```shell
npm start
```

- Start coding

### Github

- Push your code and create a pull request back to your branch
- Do not forget to ignore the .env file before you push your code to keep your credential secure
